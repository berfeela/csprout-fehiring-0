Dynamic Table with Dropdown Selection

Objective 
Build a React application using TypeScript that displays data from two API endpoints in a table. The user can select the data source using a dropdown menu, and the table should update dynamically without reloading the page.


Tasks

1. Dropdown
Create a dropdown with two options: "Posts" and "Comments"
Fetch data from the appropriate endpoint:
  For "Posts": https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
  For "Comments": https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
Trigger data fetching and table update when the user selects an option, ensuring the page doesn't reload

2. Table
Display the fetched data in a table.
Columns for /posts: ID, Title.
Columns for /comments: ID, Name.
Dynamically render the table based on the selected data source.

3. Dynamic Update
Use React's useState and useEffect to dynamically fetch and display data without refreshing the page.


Requirements
Use React and TypeScript.
Fetch and update the table dynamically based on dropdown selection.
No refreshing the page (e.g., no window.reload()).

Deliverables
A react app with a dropdown menu and a table that switches dynamically upon user's selection from that dropdown.
